bcwm
====

banana-cwm is aiming to re-implement the functionality of Tim Berners-Lee's and
Dan Connolly's Python [cwm](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html) RDF tool
kit in Scala using [banana-rdf](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf).

You can compile it with the `oneJar` command in sbt to a java binary that you 
can then run from the command line with 
```
$ java -jar target/scala-2.10/bcwm_2.10-0.1-SNAPSHOT-one-jar.jar
```
